The music is great of course, so much to see! Some cool features in the show but it is missing a huge wow that some of the other Cirque shows have. Its a small venue. Glad We went.
If you love The Beatles this is a MUST see. There was so much emotion from the actors and I definitely got chills multiple times while watching this. If you ever wondered what went on in the minds of the Fab Four I'd say this is probably a pretty accurate visualization of it. Was definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life so far. The props, choreography, and music choices flowed perfectly together. I would love to see this again and again and again!
The dancers and acrobats are terrific! The show is full of energy and the music is great! It gets a little trippy but still lots of fun.
The Beatles Vegas cirque de soleil was worth every cent. Super great show especially if your a Beatles fan. I highly recommend it on your Vegas trip.
We were staying at the Mirage so thought we would give this show a visit. So glad we did as it was thoroughly enjoyable. Very professional performance which shows the Beatles story through the years. Great music and colourful fun show.
in my 30's and grew up on The Beatles. Sgt Pepper was the soundtrack to many a family drive. To see these songs performed Cirque style was so cool. 
The show starts promptly at the listed time. I'm not sure what time the doors open, they should put that time on the ticket. I made the mistake of thinking we could walk from Aria to Mirage using the tram to Bellagio and walking through Ceasar's. Well I got us turned around in Ceasar's and we showed up at the theater at about 10 minutes to show time. The lines for concessions were outrageous. We barely made it to our seats in time. So get there early and take a cab or lyft.
They tell the crowd you can take pictures but no video. I thought this would mean people holding their devices up all night but that wasnt the case. Probably because of the older crowd demographic. In fact the crowd was super cool all night. 
My fiancé, who didnt even know Lovely Rita was a song until the last year (she heard me singing it one day and thought I made it up), loved the show so much she literally said I want to see it 4 more times. So thats a ringing endorsement from someone that isnt super into the Beatles.
Would be the biggest of Beatles fans, but gotta say this show made me go buy the album afterwards. It’s an amazing show that’s genuinely spectacular.
This was our 1st Cirque show in Vegas and sadly we weren't too impressed. The music was great. We sang along to all our favorite songs however there are scenes in the show that we didn't care for and felt that it really dragged in other parts. It definitely was not on the same level as the other Cirque shows we had seen before. 
If you choose to see it pick a low 100 or 200 section. The 200 end section are possibly the best seats. The 300 section has a hit or miss obstructed view.
Have seen this show 6 times - it’s better each time. But your seats a little more back to have best views. All of the Beatles History is relived through brilliant acrobatics. The costumes are intricate and beautiful. Don’t miss out!
Spectacular show! Definitely top on my Cirque du Soleil list! Music and performers were simply amazing and I highly recommend!
What a great show.. If you love Beatles music this show is a must! Both my husband and I were very impressed. Would recommend to everyone. Suitable for children.
Never in my life have I enjoyed or experienced such a spectacular show. This was a fantastic ending to our Las Vegas visit. Guarantee you will not fall asleep. Beautiful music and great choreography and dancing. Such a fun evening!
Excellent! Great music, lots of acrobatics. Mesmerising from start to finish. Highly recommended. Any seat is good as all close to stage
As a teen of the sixties, this show held an obvious attraction for me and my wife, however, I highly recommend it for families with members of all ages. It truly has that level of entertainment value. I am sure that the Beatles themselves would approve of this interpretation of their work.
It is a mind-boggling trip into the entire body of work by, arguably, the most important influence on music of our generation. 
If you know the lyrics, you will find yourself singing with abandon, if you do not, then you will simply sit in awe of the sound, sights, and movements of the dancers.
It is a gift you will be glad you gave yourself.
Do not miss it if you are in town, and only have time (or the resources) for a single show. You will not regret it, I promise!"
We went to see the Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil at the Mirage while we were in Vegas. What a great show. I can see why this is the No.1 show in town. Certainly worth seeing.
Worth every Penny!! A must see while in Vegas. Make sure you get good seats, the 200 level is the most ideal for a bird's eye view.
So much to see, so much great music to hear- a jammed packed show full of fantastic sights and sounds. Incredible acrobatics, great humor and Hey Jude- It's freaking Beatles ---what's not to Love?! HELP! I need to see this show again, and again, and again!!!!
8m from Liverpool so had to go see it really. Music was excellent but the show is very psychedelic and confusing.. but still very good. I'd say O was much better though
Took my daughter to see the show and she enjoyed it also. Any Beatles fans would enjoy the show. It was second Cirque du Soleil show and the performers were outstanding.
